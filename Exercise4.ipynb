        "* Subject Matter Identification - What are the topics, people, companies or places discussed in this text?\n",
        "* Sentiment Analysis - Does this text convey a positive, negative or neutral feeling about an entity or subject matter?\n",
        "* Machine Translation - Convert the input from one language to another, for example, from English to French\n",
        "* Text-to-Speech - Convert the spoken input into its written form\n",
        "* Understanding and Interpretation - What information will answer a specific question?\n",

As the field advanced, the use of machine learning enabled the application of more powerful models that took advantage of ever-growing amounts of data.  In this exercise we are taking advantage of Deep Learning to tackle ever more complex NLP tasks.\n",

This is especially relevant in NLP where inputs often differ in lengths, taking the form of sentences or even entire documents. Regardless of input length it is important to develop a representation that can capture similar themes and/or uses of domain-specific terms and vocabulary. We will demonstrate this using examples from Brian Wildsmith's wonderful children's book 'Cat on the Mat'.\n",

In the BoW representation, every unique word is a single dimension, and there are $|V|$ dimensions altogether (where $V$ is the set of all words in the corpus).  Embeddings, on the other hand, are lower-dimensional, usually between 50 and 300 dimensions. Embeddings are also dense vectors, typically possessing a value for each of the dimensions present.  Each dimension is essentially a *latent factor* that encodes some information about that particular word.  Therefore, embeddings are also known as *distributed representations*.    \n",

For these pairs, we would like the similarity score to be low.  An example for the same sentence:\n",

We'll try a dimensionality-reduction operation so that we can plot the learned representations on a 2-D plane (our computer screen).  One possible technique is [Principal Component Analysis (PCA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis). You can read more about PCA in [Section 2.12 in the course book Deep Learning](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/linear_algebra.html). We use the PCA functionality in Python's [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) library, and color the embeddings based on their categories.  'Good' embeddings will show up as well-defined clusters - individual words will be closer to words of the same category than to words of other categories.  Try running the previous cell multiple times and observe the results."

        "\n",
        "In the previous section, we experimented with the *skip-gram* version of Word2Vec.  As mentioned, there is also a different variant named *Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBoW)*.  Recall that the Bag-of-Words representation does not take word order into account.  The CBoW approach is similar - but generates distributed representations in contrast to the discrete and sparse representation generated by BoW.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this section, you will implement the CBoW approach from Word2Vec.\n",

        "#### CBoW Approach\n",

        "*CBoW architecture, slightly modified from Mikolov et al.*\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast to skip-grams, CBoW considers all words on each side of the target word simultaneously.  In the figure above, $w(t-1)$ and $w(t-2)$ are the embeddings of the context words that appear to the left of the target word while $w(t+1)$ and $w(t+2)$ are those content words that appear to the right.  In this case, the window size is 2, and in total there are 4 context words.  Once the context words are identified, the next stage is taking the *mean* of the context embeddings.  In truth, any operation that merges the context embeddings could work, such as $sum$. At this point, word order is lost and this is where the Bag-of-Words name derives from. From there on, it is a simple matter of attaching a [softmax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function) activation for selecting the 1-hot encoded context word (denoted $w(t)$).\n",
        "\n",
        "The following cell contains the code to generate sequences of length *window_size*, along with the 1-hot encoded representation of the context word."

First it extracts all the context words' embeddings, then it takes the average of them, which is then given to a single layer network to predict the target word.\n",

        "### Applying Word Embeddings\n",
        "\n",
        "In the next section, we'll see how to apply word embeddings that have been pre-trained.  We'll use embeddings generated using the *FastText* algorithm that was developed by Facebook AI.  It is similar to Word2Vec that we saw above in that it has both CBOW and Skipgram variants, but it performs the actual 'construction' of the embedding in a different way (and was specifically designed for languages that have complex [morphology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(linguistics)).  Facebook has already trained embeddings on a large corpus (in this case, Wikipedia dumps for multiple languages) and makes this data available [on the Facebook Research GitHub site](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText/blob/bc1285939f1c216bd358425c3685a049dd8f56c0/docs/crawl-vectors.md).  This link also contains a reference to the paper describing the FastText algorithm.  \n",
        "\n",
        "We will repeat the small experiment we performed at the beginning of the lab, but this time we will use FastText word embeddings.  Will our classifier be able to generalize?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Exercise**\n",
        "What happens when you switch around what objects are allowed on the mat? Will the algorithm be able to learn? Why/why not?\n",
        "Can you make the algorithm think that only stationery are allowed on the mat? How about only vehicles? How can you test this (edit in the code if you must)?"

        "In this lab, we discussed the use of word embeddings as a way to represent individual words to NLP algorithms.  We went over the issues that affect the Bag-of-Words representation, and saw how word embeddings can solve them.  We then used a small corpus to train our own embeddings, and finally used a pre-trained set of embeddings for solving a text classification problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "The concept of embeddings and distributed representations is very broad, and it will probably not surprise you to learn that there are techniques and algorithms for computing embeddings for sentences and even entire documents.  In fact, this is a one of the most active areas in NLP research.  These embeddings are able to capture semantic similarities in a domain, and so are ideal as the inputs for other, downstream NLP tasks.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, here are some best practices for training your own embeddings:\n",
        "* Use a large corpus of domain-specific texts.  Using a general corpus (like Wikipedia) may affect your model's accuracy and performance for your specific application.  If you do not have a large amount of domain-specific texts, the use of *transfer learning* on pretrained embeddings may help.\n",
        "* Plan for a training process that will take a long time.  The use of a GPU (or multiple GPUs) is highly recommended.\n",
        "* You will need to tune both embedding dimensionality and context window size. The choices you make here will directly affect the accuracy of your model and the time required to train it."
